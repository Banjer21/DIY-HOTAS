# DIY HOTAS 

This project will be updated, as of now only the joystick had been uploaded. The files need to be cleaned up a bit. 


## Getting started
The files contain multiple copies of the parts. They are somewhat logically named, _org or _empty mean that these parts are original, or have no attachement points.
They are just shells, these you can edit for your own convenience. The parts are made for specific components, which might not be optimal but do work. <br>
