# DIY HOTAS 

This project will be updated, as of now only the joystick had been uploaded. The files need to be cleaned up a bit. 


## Getting started
The files contain multiple copies of the parts. They are somewhat logically named, _org or _empty mean that these parts are original, or have no attachement points.
They are just shells, these you can edit for your own convenience. The parts are made for specific components, which might not be optimal but do work. <br>


## Thingiverse

The 3d files will also be uploaded to thingiverse once I have finalised exporting the latest versions.
Check out my [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/banjer21/designs) for some old designs I made. I will upload some more 3d models like the buttons and switches used in this project.
