# Files
There are two joysticks, a left handed and a right handed joystick. If the VGA 9 pin connector is mounted properly, both sticks can be attached to one gimbal.

The files are the version as how I printed them. Meaning there are screw holes and other additions specific to certain buttons/PCBs.

The button caps might need to be adjusted depending on your printers accuracy. They should be a nice pressure fit. 

## Updates
Please have patiens as not all files will be added at the same time. When I made the project I did not really have the intention to make it public, but since there seems some interest I have decided
to make it public. This means some files need to be cleaned up or updated to work without needing to modify them afterwards.
