# Files
There are two joysticks, a left handed and a right handed joystick. If the VGA 9 pin connector is mounted properly, both sticks can be attached to one gimbal.

There will be two versions, one that is empty, meaning no special anchor points have been made. If you want to make your own I would suggest using these as a base and editing them to fit your own needs.
The second version is how I printed it. Meaning there are screw holes and other additions specific to certain buttons/PCBs.

The button caps might need to be adjusted depending on your printers accuracy. They should be a nice pressure fit. 

## Updates
Please have patiens as not all files will be added at the same time. When I made the project I did not really have the intention to make it public, but since there seems some interest I have decided
to make it public. This means some files need to be cleaned up or updated to work without needing to modify them afterwards.
